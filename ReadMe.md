I'm a Data and product professional interested in understanding  changes in human behaviors on social media, digital products, and online communities at large. Currently, I contribute to (1) [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/sig-end-user) as an LFX mentee and my goal is to design a survey analysis and communication guide for SIG to better analyse and present their findings. (2) [CHAOSS](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-data-science/tree/main/dataset/foundational-stats-research) as a researcher to map collaboration pathways in OSS communities. 

**Here's a quick summary about me**:
- 😊 Pronouns: He/him
- 💡 Fun fact: I go to the gym 3-4 times in a week and play football on saturdays to keep fit.
- 😊 I am seeking PhD/MSc opportunities in social computing, where I can research online communities deeply.
- 💼 Job interests: I am open to jobs that allow me do behavioral studies and use my product and data skills. Generally, these could span through Product Analyst, Product Manager, UX reseacher, Community Manager. I don't care about the title, let's just do some cool work!
